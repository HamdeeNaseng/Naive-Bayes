# Outline

- Appropriate for all levels: beginners, intermediates, and advanced.
- 3 main components: 
  1. Naive Bayes Conceptual for Beginners
    - High-Level (as little math as possible)
    - Just enough to apply NB in practice.
  2. Naive Bayes Applications for Beginners/Intermediates
    - Computer vision, language, healthcare, finance, genomics.
  3. Naive Bayes In-Depth for Advanced Learners
    - Math and theory behind NB.
    - Math craziness done by Einstein in 1900s.
    - Modern science applications.
    - Any competent ML practitioner should know this.
    - base line test for any classification problem.
    - implement from NB in pythons
    - evaluate the model performance using appropriate metrics.

- Richard Feynman quote: "What I cannot create, I do not understand."
  - involving in this creation process. ensures deep understanding of NB.
