Classification review

How classification fits into the greater context of machine learning.

Why this matters: Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm, so understanding classification is foundational.

Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning

- Supervised learning: learning a function that maps inputs to outputs based on example input-output pairs.
  - Classification: outputs are discrete labels (e.g., spam vs. not spam).
  - Regression: outputs are continuous values (e.g., predicting house prices).
- Unsupervised learning: finding patterns in data without labeled outputs (e.g., clustering).

Examples

Email spam detection (classification)

| Email                                | Target |
|-------------------------------------:|:------:|
| I am a prince from Nigeria offering... | Spam   |
| Meeting at 10am tomorrow about the sprint | Ham    |
| Click here to collect your prize now!  | Spam   |

Years of experience (regression)

| Years of Experience | Salary  |
|-------------------:|--------:|
| 1                  | 50,000  |
| 5                  | 80,000  |
| 10                 | 120,000 |
