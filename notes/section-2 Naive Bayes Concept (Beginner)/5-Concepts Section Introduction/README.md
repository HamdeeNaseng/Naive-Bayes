# Naive Bayes Concepts — Introduction

This section builds intuition for Naive Bayes while postponing heavy math and theory until the advanced sections.

Who this is for

- Beginners who want an intuitive, non-mathematical introduction.
- Useful to everyone else as a refresher on classification and practical model choices.

Goal

- Gain an intuitive understanding of classification and Naive Bayes without deep theoretical derivations.

Structure (three parts)

1. Classification review
	- Review the role of classification in machine learning, expected data formats, and geometric ways to visualize classification problems.
	- Emphasizes that once you know how to set up the problem, applying ML to any data type (finance, genomics, etc.) is straightforward.

2. Bayes' rule refresher
	- A short, focused review of Bayes' rule — a core concept needed for Naive Bayes.

3. Intuition behind Naive Bayes
	- Explain how the Naive Bayes model works at a high level, what makes it "naive," and the common flavors available in scikit-learn.
	- Guidance on choosing the most appropriate variant for a given dataset.

For implementation details and mathematical background, see the advanced sections later in the course.
