# How to Succeed in This Course

Follow these three simple guidelines to maximize your learning and success.

1. Use the Q&A

   - Ask about any confusion — even small or "obvious" things. Formulating a question often reveals the answer.
   - Questions are typically answered within 24 hours. The forum is anonymous, so don't fear being wrong.

2. Meet the prerequisites

   - Prerequisites are not barriers; they point you to the background you may need. When a lecture feels unclear, review the relevant prerequisite material.

3. Get your hands dirty

   - For conceptual lectures: take handwritten notes in your own words and follow derivations step by step. Use the Q&A for unclear steps.
   - For coding lectures: code along. Every coding lecture is also an exercise — try the suggested and extra exercises. See the FAQ lecture "How to Code by Yourself" for guidance.

For the full lecture (background, rationale, and extended advice) see the course FAQ at the end of the course.
