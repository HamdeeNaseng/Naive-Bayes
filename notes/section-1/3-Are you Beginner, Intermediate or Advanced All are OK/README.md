# Level Designation for Naive Bayes Learning Journey
- wide range of difficulty between topics in Naive Bayes
- Some sections/lectures have been explicitly designed for either beginners, intermediates, or advanced
- Don't just hope that advanced content will become accessible with an intuitive explanation. Often, advanced content requires a different approach entirely. These end up just being wrong.
- How to increase your level: Workharder, improve!
- Note: designation are arbitrary so adjust as needed.

What does advanced mean?
- Advanced students will get the most out of the course because they can follow along with the more complex sections.
- Advanced means you're mentally prepared for the challenge tasks.
- Beginner dosen't mean you're unfamiliar with these topics it only means you are not mentally prepared for challenging tasks.
- it has more to do with your experience and maturity level
- I cannot give this to you you must cultivate it yourself
